# JSec

Welcome to JSec, a documentation on Java security techniques employed by various software, aimed at showcasing both the do's and don'ts. The motives behind this documentation are to shed light on the intricacies of these techniques, demonstrating how they work and, probably what you came here for, how to break them.

## Introduction

It's essential to recognize that nothing is impenetrable; however, the goal of security is to make it difficult for attackers to reverse engineer the software, slowing them down and making the process as annoying as possible in the hope that they'll abandon their attempts or wont be able to crack the software due to their lack of knowledge.

## Key Points

- This document explains what to do and what to avoid, recognizing that there will always be evolving solutions and challenges in the field of security.

- **Please understand there is a fine line between reverse engineering and cracking. Cracking is about 90% reverse engineering, However they are not the same and what you do with the information provided in this repository is not the author's responsibility, the information provided here is for educational purposes only.**

## Contributions

If you're interested in contributing, we welcome your input. However, we do have a few requirements:

### Grammar

Maintaining proper grammar is crucial for the credibility of the content. If you struggle with it, consider using software to help you. Occasional mistakes are fine, but strive for clarity.

## Documentation

Contributing well-documented changes is key. Utilize basic javadoc features. You don't need to work at Oracle, but it's important to keep the documentation clear and organized.

When creating documentation for your contribution, it is important to strike the right balance between providing detailed information and ensuring ease of understanding. While we want the documentation to be comprehensive, we should avoid overwhelming the reader with excessive information.

The primary goal of this is to make learning easier for individuals who are interested in expanding their knowledge. Therefore, the documentation should be designed to make the learning process easier and more accessible.

**However there have to be a few 'shortcuts' and a few crucial details about the process left out (this is mainly for breakdowns) in your contribution to maintain ethical standards.**
**We do not want to this to be some sort of tutorial on how to crack software, if you are a reader keep in mind some points may be left out for this exact reason.**

JSec is designed to make learning about certain concepts easier but it will **NOT** hold your hand through the entire way, it is meant to also encourage you to explore on your own.

## Issues

If you come across incorrect information or find explanations unclear, please use the issues page to report them. There's no strict format for issues, but ensure your concern is easy to understand and pertinent.

Feel free to enhance this documentation, ensuring it remains a valuable resource for baby reverse engineers.
