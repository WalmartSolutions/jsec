<h1 align="center">jsec</h1>
Documentary of Java security techniques employed by some software I have seen that I found interesting. <br>
Motives behind this we're to showcase what you shouldn't and should do.
<br><br>
It's just meant to showcase how many of these techniques work and how to defeat them. <br>
Anything can be reverse engineered or "cracked" within a certain time period, nothing is impenetrable. <br>
The point of security is to slow the attacker down and annoy them as much as possible in the process hoping they will quit.
<br><br>
I have explained what to do and what to not do here but there will always be better solutions. <br>
Harder to reverse engineer software will come out and new ways on exploiting Java will be found. <br>
This is a brief explanation on the latest ones I have encountered.
<br><br>
Please understand that reverse engineering and cracking are two different things. <br>
I do not condone cracking or in some cases reverse engineering. <br>
I am not your lawyer, and I am not responsible for what you do with the information provided by jsec.

# Contribution
If you are thinking about contributing then here are the requirements. <br>
- Proper grammar.
- Contributions have to be well documented (if they are to the project itself).

Here is the explanation of each requirement. <br>
<h3>Proper grammar</h3>
No one wants to see your bad grammar if you struggle with it use software to help you. <br>
It makes the source not as trustable and overall isn't a good look. <br>
If you happen to make a mistake or a few it doesn't really matter just don't mess up too much.

<h3>Documentation</h3>
Learn how to use basic javadoc features, you don't need to be a master just don't make it ugly.

# Issues
If you happen to find incorrect information or maybe something that isn't explained well then that is what the issues page is for. <br>
There is no format for issues just make your issue easy to understand and don't complain about "dumb stuff".
