# Java Security Techniques  (JSec)

Welcome to JSec, a documentation on Java security techniques employed by various software, aimed at showcasing both the do's and don'ts. The motives behind this documentation are to shed light on the intricacies of these techniques, demonstrating how they work and, importantly, how to defend against them.

## Introduction

It's essential to recognize that nothing is impenetrable; however, the goal of security is to create hurdles for attackers, slowing them down and making the process as annoying as possible in the hope that they'll abandon their attempts or wont be able to crack the software due to their lack of knowledge.

## Key Points

- This document explains what to do and what to avoid, recognizing that there will always be evolving solutions and challenges in the field of Java security.

- Please understand the distinction between reverse engineering and cracking. The author does not condone cracking, and the information provided here is for educational purposes only.

## Contribution Guidelines

If you're interested in contributing, we welcome your input. However, we have a few requirements:
