<h1 align="center">jsec</h1>
Documentary of java security techniques employed by some software I have seen that I found interesting. <br>
Motives behind this we're to showcase what you shouldn't and should do.
<br><br>
It's just mean to showcase how many of these techniques work and how to defeat them. <br>
Anything can be reverse engineered or "cracked" within a certain time period, nothing is impenetrable. <br>
The point of security is to slow the attacker down and annoy them as much as possible in the process hoping they will quit.
<br><br>
I have explained what to do and what to not do here but there will always be better solutions. <br>
Harder to reverse engineer software will come out and new ways on exploiting java will be found. <br>
This is a brief explanation on the latest ones I have encountered.
